This bud came with a big recommendation from the budtender. I don't know if it's just me or how it has hit me the couple times I have smoked it now, but the flavor and nuance of this bud are just not quite there. That being said – I'm not saying it's terrible grass – just that it isn't knocking my socks off. Do people still say that? Did anyone ever say that?

The buds are lovely, and smell quite pleasant. The taste is not terrible but I was expecting citrus and I got cheese. That can be weird – like when you reach for a glass of soda only it turns out it's milk.

Of course no discussion of Cherry Pie would be complete without at least  cursory mention of Warrant and their domination of the metal scene during a very particular few years in the eighties. Her name was Bobbie Brown, by the way. I had to look it up.

## Strength Notes

I think the strength in terms of potency of effect was not bad. the numbers may be off but not by much. It's a decent, lasting high. There aren't a lot of notes to it. I'm just kind of middle of the road hybrid high. Like – I can definitely deal with the world – but I'm not going to try and run a marathon.

## Taste Notes

It's got a very cheesy smell crossed with pine. Nice and pungent once its ground up. Not much before that. It did taste and act a little past its prime. Makes me wonder if the guy who recommended it smoked it when it was fresher and more fully realized. Like meeting Jim Belushi now as opposed to in 1991.

## Quality Notes

The hand picked bud experience, while slightly pricy, does lead to lovely buds. Photogenic and all around well done. A little crackly due to aforementioned age, but not problematically so.

## Overall Notes

Okay it's sweet weed for the most part. It delivers a potent high. Looks good while doing it. I don't love it, though.

This is like the Tom Berenger of weed; no one can deny it's doing a terrific job but no one really cares either.

Except I will say I loved this bud in Major League _and_ Major League 2.
