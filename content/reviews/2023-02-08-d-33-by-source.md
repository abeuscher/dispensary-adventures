Everybody loves the D. This is terrifically strong but also it's all like thinking it is an indica but I am like feeling pretty zippy. It's a Friday night and I took the day off work. Just to provide context to this current high. I'm actually writing this review at a weird hour because I ran out of weed and I have become a little adamant that I am going to do photos and reviews of all the weed when I smoke it for the foreseeable future, at least as long as it's a new strain or grower. Ideally both. So yeah that brings us up to right now, live with the D, Friday night with some super fun music playing and

Oh! Also I saw Maverick earlier. What a fucking fun movie to watch. Tom Cruise has really sort of mastered that particular space in a way few if any have before him. Like – they're not winners every one but you can tell he's giving it his all, that crazy weird bastard. I hope we can still watch them after we find out whatever he's been up to after he dies.

So – D-33. The weed so good they named it 33 times. I wonder if D-32 was super fuckin' weird? Or maybe it was like one of the middle ones – like D-19 – where they broke the mold. It's the Jason Bourne of weed strains; elusive and deadly.

If you look at the label, it explains that this is Do-Si-Do combined with Gelato #33. So that's actually why the 33.

And if you're wondering why the 33 on Rolling Rock bottles, which is a common concern among drinkers of shitty beer everywhere (I quit drinking at 16 I just know it's widely reviled by beer snobs), I offer the following situation which I assembled after almost 20 seconds of searching:

These words are printed on the label of Rolling Rock's products:

> “Rolling Rock from glass lined tanks in the Laurel Highlands. We tender this premium beer for your enjoyment as a tribute to your good taste. It comes from the mountain springs to you.”

There are 33 words in that phrase. When the phrase was originally proposed, someone scribbled a “33” above it as it was getting passed around for approvals. When it went to print, the 33 was interpreted as an instruction and the first batch of bottles was printed with the number on the bottle. Rather than admit the mistake, the company kept the bottles as they remain today.

A second, less interesting and probably incorrect explanation is that it is short for 1933 – the year in which prohibition was repealed in the US.

## Strength Notes

I mean if you read between the lines in the intro I am smoking this on a Friday after running out of grass. So just the fact that I notice the strength in this at all after being pretty baked all day is notable. I'll try it again tomorrow sober to make sure I am being fair and balanced. I'm taking that phrase back, by the way. Those are our words.

## Taste Notes

A nice piney lemony overtaste. It's a stronger smell than it is a hit. Very pleasant to smoke, though.

## Quality Notes

Tight, frosty, but yielding buds. They are just a wee bit on the small side, but in extremely good shape. Lots of crystals and interesting stuff going on on the surface, and a really beautiful consistency and texture.

## Overall Notes

I tried the D and I liked it. It's got a real potency and flavor that I like and now it's time for me to watch cartoons and maybe make a milkshake.
