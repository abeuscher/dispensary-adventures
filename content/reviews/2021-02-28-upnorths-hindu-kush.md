I didn't mean to buy this bud. I had two other strains to review today and I was just trying to buy more of the GMO offering from Up North which I reviewed last week. Unfortunately it seems others also felt that was like special show stopping bud and so there was no more of it to be had.

So I subbed in this bud here and another of the NF-1. I guess I've been having such good luck with Up North I figured I would keep at them.

This is terrific bud. A lot weaker than the NF-1 and since I just mentioned it I feel I should also compare it to the [GMO](https://dispensaryadventures.com/2021/02/23/gmo-by-upnorth/) against which it also falls short. But against any other bud it holds up very well.

Also if I had to like smoke a ton of any of the strains I have ever reviewed, this might be the one I picked. Not because it's the best but because it smokes the best. It is seriously a tall glass of water next to any bud I have smoked in a long time. No coughingness (is that a word? No of course it's not) whatsoever. Regardless of what else I write about this, odds are it is the one I am going to be rationing to myself this week because it's just plain fun to smoke.

Also worth mentioning that this is the third bud I have tested in a row tonight. I mean I take breaks but I am Not as Sharp as I was a few hours ago when all this started. Remember back then? Before the two slices of pizza? We hardly knew what we had.

All of this grass pales in comparison to the delicious east coast deli meats I have in my fridge right now. I ordered  Pastrami from Zabar's for an Irresponsible Amount of Money and I have No Ragrets.

Smoke this pot. You'll like it.

## Strength Notes

Despite its lack of strength I will admit there is a complexity to it that might make me believe in the power of terpenes if you could isolate it further.

Also this bud stuck with me like glue. Like – yeah it's not everything potency wise but it hangs around and sits on your couch for a while.

## Taste Notes

Best tasting bud ever. It almost tasted like nothing it was so smooth. It was like the best oyster. Or maybe more like smoking a Capri. Either way it made me feel rich.

## Quality Notes

She's definitely a looker. Lot's of pointy parts and also colored parts. Much like most paintings and also a lot of photographs. This bud did not look like a lunch box.

## Overall Notes

At 55 bucks an eighth this bud is definitely a buy. I like smoking it. It makes me feel high.
