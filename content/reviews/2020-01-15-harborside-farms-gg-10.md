  Love that the middle shelf is back in time for 2020. Good buds reasonably
  priced. If I was pressed to find a flaw - a little bit harsh to smoke compared
  to the upper tier I've been reviewing lately.

For “middle shelf” bud, this was pretty great. Super green and a lot of skunky aroma. The buds were tiny but nice and tight. And it smoked fairly nicely. A little harsh maybe.

As the harvest is fully cured at a lot of cultivators, it seems like good reasonably priced bud is back in town. This is my second half ounce at Harborside for a hundred bucks in the past few weeks, and both times there have been multiple choices in that price category.

Harborside is one of the few dispensaries in Northern California that grows a lot of bud for itself, and I really wonder whether this approach is going to work out for them in the long run. I think the only reason that other dispensaries have not been following suit is that they aren't nearly as well capitalized. All of the investment money seems aimed at distribution, testing, and supply chain stuff. The retailers are just not all positioned as well as Harborside. We really need to take a field trip down south to see how the scene is holding up down there in comparison.

Anyways – maybe they're Walmart, or maybe they're the anti Wal-mart. At present everyone there seems pretty happy, at least the folks behind the counter are maintaining equanimity in the face of a basically neverending line, so they must be finding something positive in the experience or be very good at faking it. Right now they get my business as often as not because they're closer than anyone else, cheaper than anyone else, and usually not annoying to get in and out of.

Which is all to say I should be making some dispensary reviews soon. I just have to figure out how to be fair when there are some I got to monthly and some I've been to twice in my life.

Good friggin buds. Thanks for playing.

## Strength Notes

This was pretty strong and definitely not being optimistic with the listed THC.

## Taste Notes

Not bad but not special. Really beautiful skunky aroma. A little harsh to smoke. Tasted a bit lemony.

## Quality Notes

Tight buds. No sticks or anything untoward. A little on the small side for people who care about that sort of thing.

## Overall Notes

Fun adventure to the middle shelf. Really you could have put this in a glass jar and it would have beaten out several top tier strains I have smoked in the past few months. For price and quality its becoming hard to beat Harborside, at least in the East Bay.
