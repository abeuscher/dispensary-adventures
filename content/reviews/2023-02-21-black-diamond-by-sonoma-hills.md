Always talk to your budtender, kids. The woman who was tending the flower at Harborside had a variety of interesting recommendations, this being the most surprising of the bunch. At 25 bucks an eighth, this is exactly the bud I would overlook without her help. And damn if she wasn't dead on; this bud is hitting way above its price point and way at the top of anything sun grown, which this is.

If you look at the picture you'll see a looser bud structure we associate with sun grown, but also a ton of the crystals and hairs we usually do not find in such abundance in outdoor buds. Obviously there are exceptions to that and this is one. What a terrific jar of grass, especially at less than half of what I am paying for pretty much everything else I tend to review.

So huge big ups and thanks to my most gracious budtender. I hope she'll help more in future and I look forward to checking out the other couple things she recommended.

## Strength Notes

A real mellow but present high. Not like I am mentally present – like the high is present. Like I know I am high. I am high. Did I say that?

It's Sunday afternoon now and it's the third time I am sampling this weed in the last few days. It's crazy how close and indistinguishable this is from the top shelf bud it's getting ground up next to.

## Taste Notes

If it loses points next to top shelf bud at all – it's in the area of smell and taste. It's not that either is unpleasant; it's just not very potently smelly. It has hints of lime and lemon, and smokes very smoothly. There's no complaint here it just didn't stand out.

## Quality Notes

Really beautiful bud. Like this is bud anyone would be proud to get outdoor. I know a few people who grow outdoor and well and this rivals any of that. I would generally expect to only find outdoor this good at Solful up in Sebastopol, where they specialize in sun grown outdoor stuff and have some of the best anywhere.

## Overall Notes

A little recommendation goes a long way. I will seek out the person who recommended this bud in future because she clearly has an agenda free and high quality range of recommendations to make. What a lovely find.
