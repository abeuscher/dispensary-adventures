It's funny I took one hit of this and I was like super underwhelmed. Then I took a second hit and my forehead became a fluffy hot air balloon. So consider me whelmed. I gotta say weed is one funny drug sometimes in that way; it'll be cool once we have some science to better explain the variation in effect between people and between smoking occasions.

Mac is not a very good name for a strain. I like the pretty box, and I have already lamented Team Elite Genetics because their logo is as ugly as their bud is good. But of course – who cares? Is the right response on those issues. Funny for discussion but they really don't impact how ridiculickulous this pot is.

I feel like I am just staying on the top shelf too often since I got back to CA. I need to make sure I sample some middle of the road weed and bargain weed just to make sure there is some variety to compare against. Because right now I am comparing this bud to a lot of others in the same percentage range and they are just so crazy good it's hard to like variate the review. So I'll endeavor to buy some shittier pot next time and see what we can learn about the middle shelf offerings in CA.

The issue there for the consumer is – the price difference is only like 5-10 bucks an eighth between the sort of median buds and the top shelf. At that level, it sort of makes more sense to buy the expensive stuff because if you are careful, it lasts longer and delivers better value. Plus you know – smoking good weed is good. And the bargain basement stuff is generally gross but I will go back to trying some of that too because out here, it's all infinitely better than anything I smoked until maybe 20 years ago.

So yeah okay I rambled a bit there. True. But this is super fun weed to smoke. Yet another strong offering from TEG, as much as I hate to grant them the abbrev, it's better than writing it all out again.

## Strength Notes

Yet another whanger from these guys. I hope they take some of their well earned annual profits and invest in a new logo.

## Taste Notes

I guess I didn't mention it elsewhere, but this bud tastes especially great. It's like smoking a lime soda and smells like lime and pine.

## Quality Notes

Slightly smaller buds, but very fluffy and well preserved. Quite lovely long hairs and trichomes (I think that's what they are) if you look at the pics.

## Overall Notes

Mac is almost as good a weed as Return of the Mack is a song. Like that is a narrow gap. This brand continues to be producing dynamite and noteworthy bud. Definitely will continue to keep and eye on them in times to come.
