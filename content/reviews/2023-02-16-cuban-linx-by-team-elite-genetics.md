  Cuban Linx is a zippy, energetic, stupid weed. It'll turn you into a Golden
  Retriever, more or less. Four paws up.

I'm smoking this grass after a real Make It Happen Sunday. I cooked a ton of food, cleaned the house, and even bought some facial scrub from China.

I know I have probably reviewed this grower more times than any other. I continue to be a sucker for their packaging and their product. Mostly their product.

Cuban Linx is no exception to the hot streak; this is urban thunderfuck crack weed. A few hits and I am just feeling giddy and mentally zippy. It says pure sativa on the box and they are not kidding.

You're not going to get a term paper written on this grass; it feels almost like an upper in the sense that you know you're going to have a lot of energy and get nothing done for several hours. Which honestly I love and makes for great fun.

I am not sure why the name Cuban Linx. There's a gold chain so it's probably some Scarface thing. Honestly there are two kinds of people in this world – those who like Scarface and those who understand what a boring, over-stylized, badly-soundtracked piece of over-directed garbage it is. If it's not clear, I am in the former camp.

## Strength Notes

Like a fire engine of fantastic, terpene fueled goodness. This is potently sativa.

## Taste Notes

Smells and tastes just dynamite. Very piney on the front with hints of lemon. It is pungent as hell after it's been ground. Smokes very smooth and easy.

## Quality Notes

Very lovely long haired, delicately trimmed buds. Losing a point because the particular buds in mine were a bit small. But man – every time I open one of Team Elite Genetics' jars I appreciate the care they give their bud and their product overall.

## Overall Notes

Cuban Links rhymes with Leon Spinx.

I had a great time, Dave. This cracked out weed made me giggle and swoon. I thought thoughts that felt important and fell away like Jenga blocks. There were moments when I was a Cuban and other moments where I was a Lynx. Well not really. But all the other stuff is accurate.
