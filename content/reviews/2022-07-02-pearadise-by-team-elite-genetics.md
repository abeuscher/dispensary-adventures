So openly – I need to start going to some new dispensaries. Just to see some variety. In this case, the variety came to me. This is a new brand at Harborside and this first experience is a positive one. This is super delicious lemony bud with a very strong and gentle punch. It's super freshy and I'm just having a lovely time. It's the weird short period in the middle of bay area summer where it is freezing right now, which is always kind of a nice time to wear slippers and eat soup.

I think this isn;t like the very strongest bud I've smoked in the course of this, but it's toward the top end. It's a little gentle and I just woke up from a nap, so there's some complicating factors in totally accurately gauging that. Did that make sense? Doesn't the word gauge always look wrong? Like colonel? and Onomatopoeia?

It's the first day of a week long vacation for me. I do not have any definite plans. So pretty successful start. I am thinking about maybe going for some walks and eating some sandwiches. Maybe a movie.

So anyways, Pearadise is just terrific. It's… okay I got a phone call and I don't know how this sentence or paragraph were supposed to end. Three thumbs up. Happy Independence Day.

## Strength Notes

Because I can still make these words, I have knocked it off from a 10. Logically a ten can never be scored as a result. There's so much irony in the world, don't you think? This bud is gentle but firm in its insistence that you are super baked. It has a pretty wide terpene profile – note that they give lots of extra info in the photo of the potency chart. I mean obviously the name of the company is silly, but it's logo looks a little like the Phoenix Foundation and do feel a little like MacGyver after smoking their weed, so I guess it's fine.

## Taste Notes

It's really simply delicious. I smoked extra and tasted it to try and locate the actual flavor. Which is lemon. And I'm super baked as a result. But also yummy. Not at all harsh. Like a lemon meringue with a few pine needles in it.

## Quality Notes

Very photogenic, fluffy, fresh buds. Not that it matters but the box and jar were also very nice. But the bud itself is like the kind you want to pull out at a party and brag about. I mean only if you want to be that guy. And really – don't be that guy you know? Because that guy kind of sucks. But it is good bud. And you can have some, If we're at a party. Which we aren't. Probably.

## Overall Notes

I had a lovely time smoking this here weed. It is the full Melvin, as they say. The entire enchilada. The big lasagna. The capo de tooty fruity. Thank you for coming over. It's been great.
