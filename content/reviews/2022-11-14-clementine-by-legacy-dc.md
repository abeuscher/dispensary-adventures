This wasn't the strongest weed in the world, but it was super pleasant to smoke. A nice brain hug for sure, and not so debilitating that I got locked down to a couch or anything. This was like super good daytime weed.

As I mentioned in the previous review – buying weed in DC – even in this place which is one of the top reviewed dispensaries in the city – feels a little sketchy. I think some of that is just me being spoiled by CA, but inventories felt low and the whole “gifting” arrangement is weird.

That being said, this was definitely bud I would have been pleased to get from the sort of “top middle” shelf anywhere in the country. It had a lovely smell and smoked very smooth. Definitely well cared for and grown. And a really nice high.

## Strength Notes

This is like a nice 7, as opposed to a condemning 7. Like – this bud wasn't trying to be the strongest kid on the block. It was just being the nicest.

## Taste Notes

This was the area in which this bud shone; really good flavor. Super smooth. There was no question why it was called Clementine; it was very citrus-y in flavor and smell.

## Quality Notes

Almost as pretty as it was tasty.

## Overall Notes

Despite its lack of overall potency, this is bud I would seek out again. It would be great strain to pull out when smoking with people who have a tendency to get paranoid or uncomfortable when they get TH (Too High). Also it just tasted and smoked super awesomely. And that is an adverb I will die to defend.
