  way.

I think if I told you that this bud smells exactly like Murphy's Oil Soap that there would be mixed reactions. It's not the soapy part. It just has the most piney pine scent and that is the product I associate that smell with. And it does smell more like Murphy's Oil Soap than it does like pine needles. On the taste side – a very pleasant and gentle piney hit. It's a nice flavor and some pretty decent little bud.

I've had to smoke a decent amount of this grass over a few days before writing a review because I don't think I had much to say for a bit. It's kind of a sleeper hit in the sense that it does not have any specific strength it just makes me feel super high. But bottom line – that is what it does. It is not super distinguishable in any way except that it is strong and has a nice flavor. But maybe that's enough. In that sense, this is like the Ed Harris of bud.

I was really hoping that my experience of writing down the effects of different strains would cause me to recognize more nuance as to the specific effects. That has not happened. I want to believe that different strains affect diff4rent areas of the brain in funny ways. That does seem to be the common wisdom, if not the common science, of terpenes. I guess my brain may be actively fighting against these various extra effects, and sort of nullifying them. But if that's the case then how can they also be real? It's a little weird how little definitive science there is on brain drug stuff. But for now I'll just close out this though by saying that I am open to these being a factor, my continued experiences seem to really conflict with that.

Good grass, though. Definitely a buy.

## Strength Notes

Definitely on the stronger side of strong. A couple hits and I was completely boinked for a good long while.

## Taste Notes

I really like the pine flavor. It does not always work but this had a lemony edge to it that made it very delicious. I would definitely smoke this again based on taste alone.

## Quality Notes

Very attractive hairy buds. No shake in the jar. Exactly what you expect from top shelf business. I liked that the actual packaging was kind of demure and understated.

## Overall Notes

This was like a sneaky good weed. It isn't flashy in how it hits or anything else but it's strong in all categories. I had fun smoking this weed, and I would probably buy it again.
