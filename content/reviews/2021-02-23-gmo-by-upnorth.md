So apparently these guys make a platinum small batch of a lot of their strains. The dude who rang me out at curbside pickup let me know this. Excitingly, I lucked into that special black label batch of this GMO, and it is just really terrific. I mean really delicious but also a great daytime bud. This is like the kind of bud that really makes you understand why growing weed is hard.

I am also smoking some homegrown that my gf and her brother harvested a month or two ago, so I have like both ends of the spectrum to compare to each other. Not that the home grown is bad at all – it is really lovely and you can't beat farm fresh grass. It's just exponentially different in terms of potency.

It strikes me to compare this a little to the NF1 since you know – same grower and I bought them a few days apart. I think the NF1 is like bud I would take out to impress a bunch of gnarly dudes, and this is the bud I would break out to impress a bunch of weed snobs. Like – yes this does not quite pack the cranial punch of the NF1, but it's like really, really easy to smoke, super tasty, and has all kinds of fancy cannabanoids that make your brain go zoom. It's on the fruity side which I think means it's more sativa-y. The Indica strains usually taste more like church incense to my unsophisticated palate.

Anyways this was a lot of fun to smoke. It's the kind of bud that makes me act smart but actually be dumber. Let's call it sophomoric. Because that sounds very fancy.

## Strength Notes

This is not the strongest bud in the world but that's okay. This is a bud that can help us realize that potency may not be everything.

## Taste Notes

Seriously worth talking about how nummy this is. Come for the flavor stay for the laughs. Is that a Newport cigarette slogan?

## Quality Notes

Look at those photos. I took extra I liked looking at this so much.

## Overall Notes

There was a party at mother's and a good time was had by all. Pretty sure that's the secret phrase in some old fantasy novel about thieves.
