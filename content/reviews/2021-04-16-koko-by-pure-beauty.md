  Koko is a Southern California brand with all the panache and zazz we have come
  to expect from that region. I enjoyed it. The box reminds me of bananas.

I've really only been buying grass in California since the pandemic began, and the difference in packaging and approach between the Southern California brands and Northern California brands is getting funnier as time goes on. This is like the most SoCal looking box ever – big and bright with a silly word on the side and not much else. I gotta be honest, I see eye to eye with the guys down the4re more in a lot of ways regarding branding. At least their stuff looks like drugs that are fun. The NorCal brands look like study aids or religious totems or something. There's all this mythology up here around weed being some sort of panacea for life. I mean I like to get high, but fuck off with that shit – it's a drug. It makes you feel silly. It's not a study aid and everyone is more able to be creative when they aren't impaired by drugs.

Rants aside, this grass was a lot of fun to smoke. It seems to be a bit on the sativa / energetic side of that spectrum. Very tasty and also pretty to look at. It has that sharper more citrussy kind of smell.

I am curious whether they named this strain after the talking gorilla. It seems likely.

Remember that movie Project X where Matthew Broderick teaches monkeys how to drop nuclear bombs? Man they did not know how to make movies with a consistent tone in the 80's, did they.

For what I have been smoking of late, this bud is like a soft “buy”. I wouldn't go out of my way for it but I would happily grab it again if it goes on sale kind of thing.

## Strength Notes

This is on the potent side but not a total mind killer. I was able to function very nicely after smoking. I even had an ice cream cone. It was delicious.

## Taste Notes

This was on the tastier side with a nice pleasant lemon-y aroma. Not super harsh in any way.

## Quality Notes

I guess if I wanted to be really picky the buds were a little smaller than you get in a standard top shelf jar. I can;t think of anything I care less about, though. See the photos for proof but this bud was totally lovely and hand trimmed.

## Overall Notes

Koko was not bad. Fun to smoke, strong enough, and even looked pretty. I am not raving about it because there is nothing to rave about but at the same time, everything worked out fine.
