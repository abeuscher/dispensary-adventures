    I do not know why this is called Magic Wand. It did not seem more magical
    than other weed. Still, I enjoyed smoking it.

Well I smoked some of this a little while ago, and was trying to figure out why they call it Magic Wand. then my roommate started yelling at me and I turned around and it turned out it was my cat. Magic!

Great flavor. Nice high potency. A little fast to come on for me.

The buds both look and smell great.

I have to say – I do not like the “artisinal” markup, but the idea that Solful is promoting in their packaging – making the farm the star – really seems to produce a solid product and a better price than any other places I've been to in northern CA. And as much as every dispensary tries to preach this hippie, community-based philosophy, Solful is one of the two (Magnolia in Oakland the other) that I can see are really putting effort into making their message a reality.

This is a business model I could see repeating if I was to start a dispensary. It seems to get good grass to good people at a decent price and make people happy along the way. that's a supply chain I can sink my teeth into.

## Strength Notes

I feel like I should make up some fake Harry Potter spell for a really juicy pun. But I got nothing. Smoke this weed; it will drain your creativity.

## Taste Notes

Tasted fruity but not potently so. Really nice aroma post-grind with slight hint of pepper or spice.

## Quality Notes

Nicely trimmed buds. Looks hand done. Could have been a little bigger and a little hairier.

## Overall Notes

Magic Wand was the bud I expected when I ordered it. Nice and potent with a slightly mellow feel. The initial high was very strong and it seemed to last a decent while as well. This is a strain I would love to see from a different grower to understand how much is the bud and how much is the farm. I've now smoked three offerings from Esensia in a row and all were top notch and seemed well loved.
