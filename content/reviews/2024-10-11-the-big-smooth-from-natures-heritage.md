  The Big Smooth, like The Big Chill, offers non stop laughs for about 90
  minutes. But also, it makes you think?

I'm now located in Amherst, MA. Where the colleges come from. It's a great spot and pretty close to the grow scene in MA, or at least some of it.

The Dispensary this grass is from is called The Heirloom Collective. It's a nice spot with a lot to recommend about it. My experiences with the staff have all been positive and they either know what they are talking about or are honest when they don't know stuff. Today's bud tender was especially good, and got what I was looking for right away: something fresh with a decent terpene profile and a reasonable THC percentage. And he was able to sort the inventory by date which was fucking awesome, and we came up with this stuff which is super fresh and just exactly what I was looking for.

It's an Indica leaning hybrid, so heavy eyelids but enough energy to make it to the store. I've been smoking high grade mids for a few weeks, so this is a nice departure back into the top shelf territory. I'm definitely a little stupid from it; this is not weed that is going to make me want to write bunch of code or build something in my workshop. Or write a super cogent top notch review.

The Big Smooth, in many ways, is reminiscent of the The Big Chill; it has an intimate, heady feeling that feels intellectual but isn't. And it seems like it will probably make the next hour and a half go by pretty effortlessly. Maybe with some decent music in between. Plus let's be honest – is there anything a lot better than a young Jeff Goldblum playing a writer from People Magazine in the mid 80s?

So this was good weed. I won't say it wins on strength, but it was mentally interesting in a way that some bud with a higher whang factor doesn't. I'm having fun. I'll probably come back and edit some of this shit later because one thing this weed is not doing is making me a better communicator. I mean writer. I mean word user.

## Strength Notes

It's not crazy strong, but it's also not weak. This is not weed I would feel at all comfortable driving on.![CHEECH and CHONG Up In Smoke "I think we're parked" - YouTube](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_v39JQZ_tyw/maxresdefault.jpg)

## Taste Notes

It's super cheesy and delicious. Also it hits really well; it's not just a clever strain name. There are undertones of blueberry in the smell, but not so much in the smoke. Very reminiscent of blue cheese type strains for smell but more in the vein of like a piny taste when it's smoked. This is weed you can smoke a little of and get a great sense of the flavor and the mental effects.

## Quality Notes

Nicely trimmed grass. Not massive buds but I've never cared about that shit or noticed that it matters. Not tiny buds, for sure. A little drier on the cure, but it's got lovely crystals and a lot of color in the closeup.

## Overall Notes

This was a nice little jar of weed. I really enjoyed smoking some of it and then writing about it here on this thing. I also gotta say – autumn in New England is a motherfucker and it has been some time since I got to enjoy it. So I'm going to enjoy this bud with some apple cider donuts then curl up with my cat in front of a nice big plate of fish. Which is my favorite dish. But without money it's still a wish. Cause I don't like to dream about getting paid. So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made…

Check out this weed and this dispensary. If you want. I'm not your mom.
