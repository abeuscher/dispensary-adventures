Hola Chinga! This weed is exactly as strong as the label on the bag says. This place is new to me but certainly not new to the Bay Area. I get the impression I am late to the party, honestly. This is legitimately some of the best weed I have bought anywhere and it is like half or less the prices I generally pay at Harborside. And they deal in much larger quantities which is also awesome for the regular consumer. So like 2 thumbs up on my first experience with CRAFT.

I found this weed by looking up the results of the SF Cannabis Cup from the last couple years, and noticing that they ranked above all the weed I have been smoking and rating highly. I guess I can say that my amateur ass agrees many years later; this is a super sativa and I'm just having a dynamite Saturday with it.

The taste is worth mentioning and singling out; this weed tastes as close to lemonade as any weed is ever going to. Like â€“ yes, you're still smoking and that's very different from a tall glass of lemonade, but the potency of the lemon-citrus flavor comes through very well in the taste of the hit. I gotta look for some better science words for these recurring flavors one of these days.

## Strength Notes

Strong as almost anything I have smoked. And a lovely, bouncy, energetic kind of high.

## Taste Notes

This weed tastes strongly and beautifully of lemon. A very smooth hit and some of the first not orange flavored weed that has come through for me on the hit as well as in the smewll.

## Quality Notes

Really beautiful buds. I mean yes it is in a bag, but these guys seem to be pretty dialed in; the bud is very fresh and as far as I can tell it has not been kicked around a lot; there is an infinitesimal amount of shake in here considering how much bud it is.

## Overall Notes

First experience with C.R.A.F.T. is a huge success. I feel like this is a much more recommendable experience and quality of bud than the crapshoot I am having at Harborside and other local, bigger shops.
