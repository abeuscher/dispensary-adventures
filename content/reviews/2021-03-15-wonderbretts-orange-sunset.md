So I got this after smoking the Orange Banana last week to see if the brand holds up in other strains. This is a sativa, and I can tell in the sense that I do not have to go lie down like I did with its brother. I gotta say – the aroma and taste of the bud are very similar to the Orange Banana.

While not as overwhelmingly potent as the other strain from these guys, this stuff is nice and strong and has a little pause before it creeps in and invades your nose bones.

This is very top shelf-y; big attractive hand trimmed buds with long ass hairs and a lot of complexity in flavor and stuff. So I guess my verdict so far is that this brand seems to be one to keep an eye on for future.

I'm really disappointed that the pandemic has stopped me from actually having dispensary adventures; I feel like without doing some traveling and seeing some other retail and wholesale space that comparing these buds against each other isn't teaching me what I want to know – which is when will the marketing and consumer scene catch up with the sophistication of the product? Because right now everyone claims everything is the dankest bud ever and that doesn't strike me as very dissimilar to where we were before legalization.

I have learned some about strains, and about how to identify bud I like from bud I do not like. So in that sense my mission continues successfully. But to really understand the marketing and hype aspect I feel like I will learn a lot more when I can finally start going inside different dispensaries and doing some travelling to other states as well.

## Strength Notes

It's not the strongest but it also doesn't make you sit down and pay attention. I was able to function and perform basic tasks which is more than I can say for this guy's little brother Orange Banana.

## Taste Notes

Delicious and citrus-y. I'm not going to say it tastes like an orange because if you ate an orange that tasted like that you'd be suspicious of it. But definitely citrus-y. Maybe a little more grapefruit than orange, honestly.

## Quality Notes

Really big beautiful buds. Smells like Christmas. Nothing at all to complain about in the looks department.

## Overall Notes

This was really great bud that didn't leave much of an impression. I liked smoking it but I wasn't fawning about it afterward.
