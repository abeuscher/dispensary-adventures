So it has been a while. I moved 3000 miles away from California, back to Massachusetts. One of the goals, among others, is to enter the cannabis industry in some fashion. So we'll see how that goes.

I'm living in Amesbury, Mass., a short walk from the border of New Hampshire. Because I am in a legal rec state bordering an illegal state, there are 3 dispensaries in my town, which is nice.

The weed situation in Mass. is a bit nascent; they have had legal weed here for a few years now but the quality is just not there. I do not know enough yet about the local scene to definitively be able to explain that, but it is what it is. Fortunately, due to benevolent geography and in part of course to the Missouri Compromise, Maine is less than 30 minutes away. Maine is a little farther along than MA in terms of quality and price; lower price / higher quality is what I mean.

So today's strain is called Black Garlic from Paul's Boutique in Maine. I'm sure there's some reason for that but the truth is that this bud smells more like grapes than any strain named grape anything ever has. If you melted a grape popsicle, that's what this grass smells like. It's not at all unpleasant; it's just weird that they named it after a plant that smells completely different.

This is decent bud if slightly dry. I bought it because the grower is named after one of the greatest albums of the 1990's and the bud tender said this was her favorite grower that the place sold. It's not wildly strong but it does have a nice high and it smokes pretty smooth. It's going to take me a few weeks to get used to the degradation in quality I have suffered in crossing the country. Along the way I was able to taste some of Colorado's finest but I really didn't have the gumption to do any reviews. It turns out that actually having Dispensary Adventures (he said it! he said it!) and then trying to write stuff down about them in real time requires a discipline that was not available to me as I hurtled across the country to relocate.

So here I am â€“ landed and trying to get back on the review horse. There is worse bud to do it with. At the very least I can listen to [Shadrach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEVfHmjKOrM&ab_channel=BeastieBoysVEVO) while I smoke it and be thematically on point.

Yo, I think I'm starting to peak, now, Al.

## Strength Notes

It's not the strongest bud in the world. But it has a nice wide effect and is a little bit disorienting in a positive way. Definitely on the spacier side for the high.

## Taste Notes

Strong hints of grape. Smells a lot like grape Kool Aid especially after it's been ground. I know I've said this a bunch in this review but is worth remarking on.

## Quality Notes

The buds were a bit dry but very pretty. Very beautiful on the trim and no shake in the bottle. I think this may be the toppest the top shelf gets here but I will continue to strive for something that is at the least a bit fresher.

## Overall Notes

I mean I would buy this bud again if I was in a hurry but due to the dryness of the buds it was a little coughy and I think maybe I could do better. Overall it was a very beautiful bud and maybe just not exactly my cup of tea. to be fair I told the bud tender I prefer sativa, and she recommended a nice sativa which we will review next, but also this one because I pressed her on her favorite. That in mind, this is a decent indica and good enough I will try the grower again if I can find something a little more recent from them.
