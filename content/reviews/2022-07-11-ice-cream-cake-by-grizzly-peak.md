  Ice cream cake is a terrible idea, but its namesake strain is terrific and
  this is some lovely, crispy bud.

While I dislike actual ice cream cakes, I am finding this bud to be very pleasant. It has a nice piney cheese smell and a spicy but smooth hit. It's got a nice light punch and after a couple of hits I am unable to find a good way out of this sentence, anyways. This is not making me smarter. That's for sheezy.

The thing is an ice cream cake is usually the worst version of both of its eponymous ingredients. Why do that when you could have the best version of each separately? Ice cream cake, to me, smacks of lazy parenting. Except for Cookie Puss. Cookie Puss fuckin' rocks.

I don't have a lot to say about this bud but not in a bad way. It tastes good, hits good, and feels good. I think it is more sedative than the Styrofoam Cup I have been smoking at the same time. I mean – you know – separately but at the same time. Like the Mormons.

I am having trouble remembering whether, with shows like Mr. Belvedere and Growing Pains – did we watch them because we liked them or did we watch them because they were What Was On? I really thinks it's the latter.

## Strength Notes

It's not like peak but it is close in terms of strength. There is not a lot of nuance to it, but there is a gentility to its onset. Like a blizzard.

## Taste Notes

Piney with hints of cheese. In many other categories of thing that would not rate highly but for weed it's quite pleasant. Also in no way harsh. Lovely to smoke.

## Quality Notes

Crispy, honky, furry buds. This shit is dense as hell and smokes up a treat. The packaging is nice and low key which I appreciate after all the concept stuff that I keep bringing home. It looks like they didn't waste more time than they should and just made great weed. Good going those guys. I hope they have a familiarity and appreciation for Grizzly Adams, a show which I remember existed and that's about it.

## Overall Notes

A pleasant ride, even if it shares a name with a flawed concept. I would not like rush back for this but I also wouldn't shy away from it either. It is unremarkably super.
