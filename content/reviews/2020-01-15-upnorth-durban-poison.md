I was turned on to this strain by the bud tender at time of purchase. I had initially planned on buying something from 1Lyfe, one of NorCal Cannabis' lifestyle brands, to see hwo it stacked up against their Big Al's. I happened to mention to the bud tender that I was touring the top shelf and he gave this a big recommend.

It lists as 33% THC which really seemed a little weirdly high, but he assured me that it was not a misprint or someone sending their stickiest kolas to the labs. Plus it was like 5 bucks cheaper than what I had in mind so sold.

This bud was really something special. Though not too much to look at trim wise – who friggin cares? These buds feel like glass they're so crystally. And the taste is fantastic. Super smooth. And a serious one-hit-will-solve-all-of-your-problems thing going on.

Was told that this is a brand to watch, so I will keep an eye out for more in future.

Minor Digression : I really WANT there to be a reason that bud is priced how ti is at the stores. As much as I am skeptical of it all – I want there to be order to this chaos because otherwise I am just randomly betting with my money every time I go. I feel like so far since I started thinking about my trips to the dispensary this way – the bud tender has become a lot more important than previous. I find I interact more about the product at the counter than I did before, and I find that they share a lot of my skepticism as far as pricing goes. So when I smoke bud like this after having it solidly recommended it helps to build my consumer trust back up, and that is a nice feeling. End digression.

## Strength Notes

This is about as strong as bud gets, but I'm still not speechless, so the 10 is held in reserve.

## Taste Notes

Awesome spicy taste. Very smooth.

## Quality Notes

Loose trim and smaller buds. Made absolutely zero difference to how great this bud was, but it was not the most beautiful.

## Overall Notes

This is so far my second favorite bud I've bought inside of this experiment after the [Big Al's Mai Tai](https://dispensaryadventures.com/2019/12/27/review-big-als-mai-tai-flower/). The two are very comparable – I just like the fruitier notes in the Mai Tai better by personal preference. But it was awesome and I am going to struggle to save some for the GF in a few days.
