  good paella.

New grower for me. Very happy with this bud. Look at the size of the main bud – it's like most of the eighth. Not that it matters but big fluffy buds are like the Brown M & M's, it seems; they do not specifically denote a quality organization but they do at least convey that the grower / manufacturer cares about every little detail. And often that leads to the most exciting and interesting bud.

Whether that's a sound theory or not, this bud is that kind of bud; I mean the good kind. The kind that we like. The icky, wicky bomb bud.

And so on.

So the high is great, the appearance is stellar. The strength is reasonable and I do like it. For me, I think it inhabits the uncanny valley of bud where I am more high than I think I am but the bud makes me feel sort of mentally present in a deceptive way and that's what's propping it up.

Or, based on the quality of that sentence, I'm just high and rambling. At least that's thematically consistent with our intents here.

## Strength Notes

Deceptively strong. Don't try to operate a forklift while smoking this weed unless you are a really good forklift driver with a lot of stoned hours behind the wheel. And if you do match that description – let's just take a moment to appreciate how awesome you are. Thanks for being you, Mr. or Ms. Stoner Fork Lift Driver.

## Taste Notes

It's a very lime and pine kind of scent when ground up. You don't necessarily get a lot of that when you smoke it. Still very pleasant and not at all harsh, especially for 6 month old weed.

## Quality Notes

I mean just look at that big honking bud and appreciate it. It's the kind of bud you feel bad to break apart, but oh so good that you did. I appreciate they took the time and energy to make it big and awesome. Good job, House of Congo. Nice QA.

## Overall Notes

While I have yet to discern why this is called Waiting Game, that should not prevent you from hearing about how good it is. A nice, mentally active high and a pleasure to encounter in all dimensions. I look forward to trying more from these guys in the future.
