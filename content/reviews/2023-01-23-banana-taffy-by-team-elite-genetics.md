I have to say – I am probably reviewing too much of Team Elite Genetics weed proportional to my other choices, but I just keep finding their weed to be terrific. Also, if I am honest, I am a sucker for decent packaging. I don't like their logo, but they have these nice, squat jars and cartoon-y designs on their boxes which are just very appealing. Stupid, I know. Shouldn't make a difference.

I do think a little of branding and marketing like Brown M & M's were to Van Halen – kind of a harbinger of whether a business is run well and functioning correctly. And of course that's going to filter down into product quality a lot of the time. Of course there are massive exceptions to this. But you know – generalizations, amiright?

So more importantly – this weed is just a big pillow of marshmallow fun. It's a nice quick, potent high and I'm just getting off work on a Friday. So let's just pause a moment and feel a little awesome about that. Because feeling awesome is awesome.

Remember that club track, Laffy Taffy from like a bunch of years ago? Lemme look it up one sec.

This one:  

That shit was awesome. This was from like right in the middle of when I was a pub trivia DJ. A real ass shaker. Plus it was about candy so you could tie it in with the questions about candy and have some synergy. Because pub trivia is all about synergy.

I think that song pretty much sums up how I feel about this weed, from an ass shaking perspective anyways.

## Strength Notes

Definitely one hit and done weed for the novice smoker. Very potent and shwifty. I'm not absolutely knocked out energy wise, but I'malso not going hiking. I could definitely make it to the kitchen if I needed to. But maybe I will play with my cat instead.

Once again, Team Elite Genetics, a name which may very well have been randomly generated, has delivered some really terrific pot. And I smoked it, And now I'm telling you about it. That pretty much beings us up to the present moment.

## Taste Notes

A very distinct cheese and pine smell is coming off this bud, even before I ground it up. It's not as strong a taste when smoking it, but it's not overly harsh and I didn't cough a ton.

I do not detect any hints of banana and taffy, which is kind of a relief. I love me some taffy but I do not like bananas and I especially hate things that are banana flavored. It's like a bad knockoff of something that is already terrible. Like if there were imitation Hydrox Cookies. Or off-brand Nrcco wafers.

To be clear I am not talking shit about this weed. I am talking about banana flavored candy. Which this weed is not like. Pleasantly so. I don't know why you found that so confusing. Try and keep up; there's genius stuff happening here. Word usements of infinite proportion abound.

## Quality Notes

This bud just seems well loved. Like all of their stuff does – every single previous review of these guys – it's all in really good shape, super fluffy, extra photogenic, and a pleasure to work with as well.

Some of the more dense buds I've seen and have been buying will gum up your grinder or turn into powder. This grinds up all fluffy and nice and everything works. Good going, guys! I hope you all have dune buggies and lots of friends and vacations. Because generally that's what makes life worth living. And by that I mean dune buggies.

## Overall Notes

Banananana, as Nanny Ogg once said, is a hard word to stop spelling.

This bud is not perfect, but it's well made, nice and strong, and leaves me in a good humour. Which I am going to spell that way because I mean it that way.

I, for one, hope that Team Elite Genetics invests some of the money that I have spent on their weed on a decent logo. But other than this increasingly small yet oft focused upon flaw, they've once again made me stoned. Good job, everyone. Fruit roll ups all around.
