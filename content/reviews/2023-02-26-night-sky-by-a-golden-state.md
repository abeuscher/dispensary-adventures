This is just snazzy, relaxing, well cared for marijuana. It's my second offering from these growers, and another nice hit. Maybe not a home run, but definitely a triple.

If you look at the pictures, these are nice, dark purple buds. They are quite crystalline and a little dense, but they grind up well and do not turn to powder.

I feel almost even keeled after smoking this for the past couple hours. At first I was very sleepy, but most of that is just from getting off work; I often crash for the first 45 minutes or so after I sign off for the day. After that, I had no trouble making a couple of cheeseburgers. So it's not the most debilitating high ever, bit it does certainly lend itself to making yourself comfy and not doing a whole heck of a lot. But you will be able to make cheeseburgers so don't worry.

I am reminded from the strain name that in the house I grew up in – my grandparents' house – there was a small, closet size bathroom in the basement which had sunflower yellow walls and had postcards of lots of Van Gogh paintings and a couple of books on a shelf behind the pot about Van Gogh. It was the Van Gogh Bathroom. And now, in my adult life, I have the Ronald Wilson Reagan Memorial Bathroom. So the tradition continues in a certain lateral way.

## Strength Notes

It's not overpoweringly strong, but it definitely has a lot of character as a high. For me this was an extra body centered feeling of relaxation. I definitely have significant cognitive impairment but so nicely. This is how blue whales must feel. In their more serene moments.

You ever see whales fuck? This weed was nothing like that. Sick bastards.

## Taste Notes

There isn't a huge overpowering smell or taste, but what there is is pleasant. It's a lemon-y front with sort of a deep incense following it. This does not really come across in taste, but it hits nice and smooth.

## Quality Notes

Beautiful buds. Very well cared for and nice crystals and whatnot. Very easy to work with and less brittle and dense than it might look; this was very nicely taken care of the whole way through its little life.

## Overall Notes

I had a quiet and tranquil evening with A Night Sky. It was lavender and tame and mellow. I am going to keep an eye on these folks because this and their last bud were really intereting ends of a spectrum.
