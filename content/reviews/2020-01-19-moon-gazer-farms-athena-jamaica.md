  Very Middle of the Road, but in a good way like the song, not a bad way like
  the place to sleep.

I can't seem to remember the name of this strain for more than about thirty seconds. For this reason I feel that Athena Jamaica is the Roman J. Israel Esq. of strain names.

Absolutely nothing wrong with this in any way. It was very pretty, smoked quite well, and had a nice mellow high. I had a really lovely time using this to relax after smoking too much of the [Super Sour Diesel from Lady Sativa Farms](https://dispensaryadventures.com/2020/01/19/lady-sativa-farms-super-sour-diesel/) which I bought at the same time from the same place.

One detrimental note is that I was not able to detect the fruit hints mentioned on the label in the aroma or the smoking flavor of the bud. I guess it was on the fruitier side of that spectrum, as opposed to a very heavily incense-smelling bud, but it did not match expectations I had when looking at the bottle in the dispensary.

## Strength Notes

Mellow but insistent. I did find it crept up after a minute or two.

## Taste Notes

Not in any way unpleasant but also not fruity. And it said fruity.

## Quality Notes

Loose trim. Looked very hand grown and loved. Nice crystals on the buds.

## Overall Notes

This was awesomely average bud. If every underwhelming eighth I bought was this good I would be a lucky person. Nothing wrong with this bud in any way. It definitely suffered by being bought alongside the [Super Sour Diesel](https://dispensaryadventures.com/2020/01/19/lady-sativa-farms-super-sour-diesel/), which really stood out from the crowd as a paramount Sativa, while this was like totally great bud with nothing to distinguish itself as special.
