Buying weed in DC is weird as hell. They have a medical program which out of state residents can join for like 30 bucks for 30 days and it's just an online signup – no doc's appointment necessary. They also have a “gifting” arrangement for recreational, where you basically are technically buying an NFT but you get a “gift” of weed with it. It works but it's all kind of stupid.

Additionally the dispensaries seem a little skeevy across the board. Cannabliss, where I bought this grass, was chill inside but the neighborhood it's in is a little suss. Like we were there during the daytime and my brother did not feel okay in the bodega he went to next door while I picked up the grass. And he's generally very chill with, say, Oakland and whatnot.

So despite having had some less than positive vibes from the scene here, this weed was super delicious, very aromatic, and packed a pretty serious punch. I have smoked like maybe 6 or 7 strains here and this one stood out as the best in the bunch. It can defiintely go head to head with any of the bud I have bought since leaving California.

## Strength Notes

Nice and strong. A little less couch lock and a little more fun time feeling.

## Taste Notes

This bud really stands out for taste and aroma. It is super freshy freshy; hints of pine and lemon and just lot and lots of smell when you open the bag. And it tastes like notably delicious.

## Quality Notes

Weed in a bag is never quite as ell preserved, but the lopsided buds and such did not inhibit enjoyment in any way.

## Overall Notes

I would definitely go back for ore of this if IU was hanging around DC for much longer. I have one other strain from this grower – Peach Flambe – which I also like but is not as standout as the Spritzer.
