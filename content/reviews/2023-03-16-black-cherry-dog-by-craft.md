Second offering from Craft is only very slightly less impressive than he first. While Dimepiece stood out amongst all weed, this BCD is a little more Center of Top Shelf; there is nothing at all wrong with anything it's just not bud that you would run over to your friend and insist they smoke immediately. If you know what I mean. Like – Jim Belushi is, by any measure, a very successful and competent comedic actor. The only time he seems a little pale is when you compare him to his big brother. I have heard that he grows pretty good weed, by the way.

Much like Curly Sue, Black Cherry Dog was a decent way to spend an hour and a half. It's a little on the sativa side, and has a light and pleasant diesel smell after it's ground. Not too much of this comes through on the hit, but it does go down smooth.

## Strength Notes

This was nice and strong and sort of right in the middle between sativa and indica. Really terrific high and super fun to smoke.

## Taste Notes

The smell was a bit diesel-y, but there was very little taste on the hit. Nothing unpleasant just a smooth sort of generic weed taste that many strains have.

## Quality Notes

Beautiful buds and another really top shelf entry from CRAFT.

## Overall Notes

It's weird to go back to buying fairly big bags of weed from going through only 8ths. I must say, though – the price differential between C.R.A.F.T. and what I have been paying for branded grass at Harborside is dramatic. Like – I can roll joints and not even feel bad about it which I like. Unfortunately due to a stoner mistake on my part, I actually ended up ordering 2 1/2 ounces of this grass so it is all I have been smoking for a week. Which is like great from the perspective of lifestyle choice but annoying in that I do like to blog about weed and this put a bit of a wrench in that plan.

But I made it through the ounce like a champ and I have some new strains to talk about in upcoming days. Never fear.
