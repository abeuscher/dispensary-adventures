This is pretty much what I expect from the lower tier / bargain shelf of grass. It's a little on the weak side, not the most lovely, and it's a bit crumbly. I think that the crumble comes from being overcured, but I could totally be wrong about that.

In any case, I was neither under nor overwhelmed by this bud. It was very whelming. I have been whelmed.

Not bad for the price, but I'm not going back for more either.

## Strength Notes

When you buy lower priced bud, I notice that they do not list the THC% as they do for the bud that is priced higher. That would have been nice here. With a THC level of 17.7$ (which I honestly didn't notice at the counter and my bad for that), I guess I can say that it got me nice and baked and wasn't unpleasant even if it took a couple extra hits.

## Taste Notes

This bud actually tasted quite nice. It had a very rich and not at all unpalatable earthy flavor. Like kissing an ent, but like a hot ent who really does it for you.

## Quality Notes

Buds were kind of crispy. About 1/3 of them were on the small-enough-that-its-a-problem side. Still nice to look at though, as you can see from the photos.

## Overall Notes

This was the Modern Family of bud. It was just good enough that I'm not annoyed afterwards, but not nearly good enough for me to want to watch any more of it. I mean smoke any more of it. I mean â€“ it got me high. It's not like broken or wildly misrepresenting itself.
