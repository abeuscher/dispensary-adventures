There's a gap between when I bought this and this review of about 40 days. That's mostly because I traveled and lost my job. I mean – I know where my job is – just when I go there there's this new guy doing it. RIP Louie Anderson, amiright?

So there's a gap. And now I am returned with this and the review before it, and everything is totally cool and awesome. And I get to try and enter the cannabis industry. so that'll be fun. Now about this weed…

Really amazing stuff, even after sitting on my desk unloved for a month. A very strong diesel odor and not unpleasant hint of that when it hits. And it's a fucking brain monster. I've had a couple of hits and I am having a super busy time trying to negotiate this keyboard and my thought musements. So much I had to make up a word there just to keep up.

I've been smoking all around the country once again and I have to say – flower like this is unique to Northern California so far. I think Colorado must be doing somee interesting thingss, but the last time I was there I found none of it. It's not so much the percentages – those exist in other places. But thiss bud is like science-d the fuck out with terpenes and whatnot. Not to get all technical about it. It seems like other growers are trying to get just random potency and the growers here are trying to make specific blends. Like – they are aiming for something more specific.

In my next phase I am definitely going to figure out what it is. But for now – I will enjoy the shit out of this bud, which is just overpowering and fun. I feel like a bagel.

## Strength Notes

Less of a punch in the face and more of an arresting need to chill and be awesome. Like I specifically feel awesome. Is that a terpene? Is this?

## Taste Notes

Like how do you say something tastes pleasantly like gasoline? I mean except with those words.

## Quality Notes

As pretty to look at as it is to smoke. Fluffy, complex, and wild. Like Phil Spector.

## Overall Notes

Welcome back to here! I am so lucky to be able to smoke weed this good all the time. I am having an awesome day. I think I'll go water my plants.
