With a strain name like Quest, hokey packaging, and a super pretentious brand name – I really wanted to make fun of this weed. Truth be told it's actually really good grass and not badly priced against the other strains in class. Despite the silly name and a few too many concentric circles on the packaging, this was really pretty good bud.

On the other hand I am not going to run out and buy more of it. But I guess I'll say this: I've become conditioned to there being an inverse relationship between how “new age” a package is and the quality of the weed therein. This bud totally thwarts that model. It doesn't make me like question my methodology, but it does sit outside the norm.

I am also finding that while I can't weigh in on one terpene versus another that there does seem to be a relationship between the number of additional cannabinoids and the “interest level” of the weed. So I guess I know my brain is being tickled it's just hard to say by whom. And this bud had quite a bit of that tickly, interesting stuff going on.

I will take this weed as a cautionary lesson to not judge a strain by its box.

## Strength Notes

For bud like this I kind of wish I had allowed for fractions because it's really more of a 7.5 than an 8. I definitely could feel it after a few hits though. It's sativa-ish, so definitely did not incapacitate me. It may have made me more chatty than normal but it's hard to tell because I don't have anyone to talk to. But I definitely feel chatty.

## Taste Notes

A little lemon-y, but nothing  to write home about here taste wise. When was the last time anyone actual ever wrote home? It may be time for a new idiom. This bud was also on the harsh side for the upper shelf price point.

## Quality Notes

Really nice looking bud, and quite a pungent aroma. No complaints in the appearance category for all that really matters.

## Overall Notes

I was pleasantly surprised overall, but this bud does not really excel in any particular category. Kind of a Breckin Meyer level strain. Like – you know his name but what has he really done?
