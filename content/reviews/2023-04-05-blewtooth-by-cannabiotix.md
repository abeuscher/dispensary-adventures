This is a zippy little offering. Definitely a sativa, and very tasty. It has hints of lemon and pine, and a decent amount of complexity to the high. It's definitely an energetic and clear minded kind of a high. A lot of fun. This is good daytime weed for sure. Though of course smoking it at night was also a pleasure.

## Strength Notes

A strong sativa that leaves you with a little edge. I really liked this weed but it definitely is suited to daytime activities and moving around. It's not gonna help you “make it happen” but then again that is not weed's job, no matter which strain it is. But you'll still be able to go for a walk and hunt for truffles.

## Taste Notes

This bud has a beautiful spicy lemon scent. It comes through in the hit a bit, and in general it's really lovely to grind and work with.

## Quality Notes

Nothing but frosty, fresh, well maintained buds. Aesthetic from top to bottom

## Overall Notes

Someone said to me in a local subreddit that they feel as though CBX is the most potent brand out there. I don't think this is true, but I do think they are probably the best combination of widely distributed + high quality. You can find CBX in most dispensaries I have been to in both Northern and Southern California, and I have never really had weed from them that wasn't really outstanding.

That being said, mass produced weed has both a floor and a ceiling, and there are smaller batch growers (UpNorth, for instance) who have the potential to really knock it out of the part with a particular offering that I think CBX is just capped against. Trying to make and package any product at scale is going to limit quality at so0me point even if you are Rolls Royce. And Cannabiotix seems to care a lot for their weed but they are NOT Rolls Royce in the space. They are more like Mercedes or Jaguar: mass-produced status symbols. Okay the analogy fell apart at the end but you know what I mean.
