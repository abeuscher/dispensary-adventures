Okay this is the bud that actually made me start to want to write some more reviews after a long break. Kazowie this shit is strong. Like – okay – I really like the Super Silver Haze I got along with this and reviewed along with it, but – I wanted to make this point: The Super Silver Haze was 10 bucks more and listed itself as 4% higher in THC. But while both are great – there is No Way that the Silver Haze is anything like as strong as this. This is the brain hammer. Do you know how many spelling mistakes I have had to correct in this review already? I mean I took one hit and it is like the words not good at making come out of brain no more. Right?

\[Pause to enjoy this bud\]

Want to briefly unpause and say that when I first smoked this bud last week I was like “I have to review you!” in the same way that people say like “I need to paint you!”

\[Okay repause I need to play a video game or watch a cartoon to calm down for a bit\]

Just to recap a few days later – this bud was a lot of fun and I have since gone on vacation and bought more. Because hot damn!

## Strength Notes

This is among the strongest bud I have ever smoked. Full stop. I mean I actually had to write this review later because the word usements were not happening. It's almost artless how succinctly this bud will lobotomize you, but it is in fact completely artful.

## Taste Notes

This tastes good but not amazing. Hints of incense mixed with lemon and dirt.

## Quality Notes

Really amazing looking grass. And amazing smell as well. This is top shelf and it's easy to tell.

## Overall Notes

I think the NF1 is going to remain in memory (now that I have written it down) for some time as one of the more potent buds I have smoked. I have gone back for thirds on this stuff. If you have a problem and no one else can solve it, maybe you can hire the NF1.
