I am struggling to figure out how I really feel about this weed. It's definitely not terrible, but it feels like it's prettier than it tastes. Everything about it is just a little off the mark. It seems kinda potent but fades pretty quickly. I have really liked the other two strains I have bought from these guys. And I like sativas – to the degree that I believe there is a meaningful distinction to be made there.

To be fair to the weed I had kind of an annoying day and that is not the weed's fault. The weed only wants to help. But still – kind of underwhelming and not super jazzy. It is lovely to look at and I think the name is very science-y. But still I think of the three I have tried from this brand this one is the weak man on the totem pole. I mean – the low man on the race course. He is not at the top. He is below that. I don't like this weed that much.

## Strength Notes

Not super strong. Not super great. In no way terrible. But at the price point and after having sampled from these guys before I am not impressed. This is a sheep in wolf's clothing.

## Taste Notes

A nice taste and a smooth hit. I am not going to just ditch on this weed for the sake of it and it totally had a mild orange-piney flavor and aroma which were pleasant. It is nice weed to smoke it's just nothing special.

## Quality Notes

I mean it looks amazing. The buds are fluffy and super duper fresh. This weed was like less than 2 weeks in the bottle before I got it and it was in tremendous condition. I just didn't like it. Perhaps the most annoying thing about this bud is that it is going to get a decent score even though it's kind of meh.

## Overall Notes

I may chalk this one up to me having a bad day. There's nothing overtly wrong with this bud it just isn't particularly outstanding in any category. I think it is definitely suffering because the last weed I smoked was a perfect 10, and every other offering from this brand has been off the chain until this one.

In the end, this is a lot better than bargain weed. It may even belong on the top shelf. I just won't be buying it again.
