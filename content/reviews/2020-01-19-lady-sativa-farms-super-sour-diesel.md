This bud is from a pretty interesting little dispensary named Solful up in Sebastopol. They sell and package and price their weed very differently than other places around here and it's actually a pretty big improvement over a lot of other places.

This bud was super green and very crystally. A little looser than the more factory produced bud I have tried from some other places, but that seems to be neither a positive or negative, at least so far in my experience. It was very reasonably priced for the region at 40 bucks for an eighth, and I was frankly overwhelemdd by the strength a bit at first. This bud was very reminiscent of the first weed I ever bought in the Bay Area – in small little gram or 2 gram bags at Haight when I was here with a friend on vacation in the 90's. I think it was referred to as the Humboldt Kind. I have no idea if that is a reference to a true strain, or just a way to describe the bud from Humboldt County. In either case it was very bright green and pungent, and in this way very similar to this crazy dragon of a bud.

## Strength Notes

Shabam! I really like a nice strong sativa. Makes you feel it in your cockles. My cockles really enjoyed this one.

## Taste Notes

Rating this lower on taste because I'm not sure that is has much of one.

## Quality Notes

On the one hand they were a little loose. On the other hand they were covered in crystal goodness and such a lovely color.

## Overall Notes

I feel like this bud is ending up scoring a little low considering how much I enjoyed it. Then again I have been sampling the best pot in one of the most famous weed growing regions in the world, so the competition is pretty fierce. I recommend the dispensary – Solful – as a refreshingly different take on how to stratify, organize, and package weed in a storefront. It really is so much easier to navigate than a lot of other places and ends up taking a lot less time to get in and out. Also they give big respect to their farmers and really make them the stars. I think this is forward thinking and that they are going to do very well in the long term if they keep what they've got going on.
