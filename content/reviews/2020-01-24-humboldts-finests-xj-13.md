This was unbelievable value for the money. Really delicious, absolutely beautiful huge buds – everything you want. Really delicious bud that had kind of a purple flavor. I reallyu need to read a book on tastes because I am finding it hard to describe the differences.

XJ-13 is one of the few strains I remember being mentioned by name back in the early 90s when finding high quality bud was still something of a rarity on the east coast. I distinctly remember one of my guys getting in a crop of XJ-13 / Freeze crossbreed and that being like one of the memorably best hookup\[s I had in that era. And I almost never remembered the stupid names they gave bud back then because much more often than not it was a sales angle, not anything to do with the plant's origin.

I know those days are passed, for the most part, and in that respect I really won't miss them at all.

## Strength Notes

Surprising kick. Really numbed the frontal lobe in a pleasing and robust manner.

## Taste Notes

Tasty stuff. As I said – kind of purple-y.

## Quality Notes

This was like better looking bud than it had any right to be. A couple of the buds were friggin big too. Next time I'll try and remember to weigh out the chunky ones before I smoke it all. Alas, it is too late for that now.

## Overall Notes

Finding a lot of interesting variance in the middle tier of buds. This one seemed a lot closer to the top shelf buds I've been looking at than I expected.
