I was away this weekend and a friend had some weed that was really badly cured - like it smelled a little burned and a little like fresh grass. It turned out it was pretty strong but it tasted like ass. I grabbed this weed on the way home from that, and it suffers from a less awful version of the same phenomenon.

I happened to speak to a grower about it this afternoon and she said this particular ailment is due to too much humidity during the curing process, which makes a lot of sense - though this weed was packaged 10/1, it was harvested 7/1 - in the middle of a humid-ass New England summer. Yes it was indoor and I'm sure they did their best, but I think this explains the sort of "off" smell and taste of this otherwise dynamite weed. 

I sincerely was expecting to be disappointed after opening the bag, but it was super heady bud, a really nice high, and definitely not as poorly named as, say, [Runaway Bride](https://dispensaryadventures.com/2021/03/11/keys-runaway-bride/).

## Strength Notes

This really is "take a minute to compose yourself" kind of grass. I wasn't expecting it to be; my roommate walked in right after I took a bong hit and I did my best Neil from the Young One's impersonation (look it up if you're under 45). Totally stupid. I couldn't have even made lentils.

[Lentil Nightmare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nqm3x8rNyuw&ab_channel=Arianddu) can be found there for the uninitiated. It's not amazing but then again, how many songs are there about lentils to choose from?

Seriously though - it's sneaky strong, and it's not just a clever name; it is spacy as all get out. And I mean that in a very folksy way.

## Taste Notes

As mentioned elsewhere - this weed has a cure issue and it strongly affects the taste. This is very burning-tasting, with hints of fresh mown grass and sand. I don't usually ditch on weed for tasting bad because after all you're lighting it on fire and smoking it - how good could it get? But this was nasty enough to mention thrice.

## Quality Notes

It's pretty weed. The pictures speak for themselves on that. It's a shame someone took such a lot of care growing and trimming this bud and just didn't cure it well, or made some mistake or whatever - maybe it was too hot like I guessed in the main review.

In any case, it's got big buds, lovely hairs and crystals, and grinds up beautifully. Nothing but good things to say here.

## Overall Notes

It's crazy, as you get to know people who grow professionally and those who try it out at an amateur level, how many things there are that can go wrong. Grass like this, for all its flaws, makes me appreciate when bud hits every single note correctly, and reminds me of the time and care that goes into that. In the age of the commodification of marijuana, it's good to remember that it is not, in fact, a commodity, and that individual grows can stand out because they do everything right and it shows in the quality of the product they provide. Anyone who doubts that there is a "top shelf" could be easily swayed with weed like this - where yes it has the strength but the flavor really does bring it down a full notch.
