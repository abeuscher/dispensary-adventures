Smoking this weed makes me want to do some research and understand the relationship between THC, terpenes, and overall strength. What I think is true, is that while this bud is a littler lower than some in overall THC %, it's terpene profile is pretty broad, and this is what makes it as potent as it is.

What I mean to say is â€“ this weed is bangin' strong, and its numbers are well below the4 last few strains that I have smoked. BUT it has big overall numbers, and I think that's why.

Good chance I will go finally try and find some decent science on this. It's something I have been thinking about for a while while smoking all these different strains. I would say that 9 times out of 10, the THC% and package date will lead you to a fairly good choice. But what you may be missing out on using that technique is buds like this that have some really unique and entertaining mental properties, but are not testing high inside of those metrics. So there's an opportunity for me to gain some nuance here and I will try and do so.

I'm having a lovely time with this bud. I'm feeling it to be quite a giddy, jumpy kind of high. I started off my day with a flat tire, so it's nice to finally be distracted from that, and the donut I never got as a result of it. Lost Donut is a pretty good song name, but maybe not strong enough to be a band name.

## Strength Notes

It may not be the strongest bud in the world but it's a notably great high. Generally I am all Terpenes Shmerpenes, but this makes me think twice about that.

## Taste Notes

This weed has a very bright smell and, to some extent, taste. It's not over-pronounced when smoked, but it has a very lemony fresh scent with a hint of pine and incense. Really like this is what you want all the weed to smell like.

## Quality Notes

Nicked one point because there's a couple tiny buds tucked in there, but I don't actually give a fuck except for some dumb aesthetic. This was super fluffy, bouncy bud. It filled the jar that some of these eighths like barely cover the bottom of. It doesn't just smoke better; it makes it easier to smoke it over a longer period of time.

## Overall Notes

There's lots to recommend here. I'm quite happy with this bud and I sort of assume it would be a little more factory, coming from what I thought was a large scale grower. Fluffiness beyond expectation and a fun high that hit me just the right way. I liked it so much I didn't even once make fun of its kind of unimaginative name. Except for just then, I guess. But that was pretty passive aggressive.
