Well it's the first review of a new year. And I am back in CA after a 4 month journey through the US.

For many reasons, the quality of the grass being one of them, it is good to be home. The first thing I did in CA was go to a dispensary. I was in Needles, a border town between AZ and CA, and the bud there was just terrific. Then I went and got a pizza. Then I lost my pillow. t was quite a night.

Speaking of terrific bud, so is this Alpine Sunrise from A Golden State. Having just smoked several bong hits to my head, I am challenged to hit the keys on the keyboard in the correct order. The more I think about it the harder it gets. But really – this is great pot. My cheeks are high. My eyes feel stoned. My fingers are finging like nobody's business.

I will have to sample this bud again later but right now this is feeling like a top contender in terms of potency. I was honestly expecting very little from it and I am pleasantly surprised. It's a pretty unassuming package and not a brand I am at all familiar with. But if this is what they do consistently then this is one to watch. It was, relative to some of the toppy top shelf bud at Harborside, a not crazy $55 bucks for the eighth.

While I have been chucking out the first few paragraphs of this review, [this was my soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIaN9FL7NEI). You may recognize the intro from that song by that guy from the 90's with the twin sister.

So okay – first review of the new year is a big smash. I'm so happy about that. I am trying in my own Not a Resolution kind of way to be more consistent with reviews. We'll see how that goes. I think probably the thing for me to do is to build a backlog. That's how the pros do it, I understand. Also I am adding a “faster” photo studio to my desk. I think the quality didn't suffer. But we'll see.

To get back to the matter at hand – I have no complaints about this here bud. I am smoking it right at quitting time and good thing because I am definitely not in a position to do anything in a professional capacity. Except maybe like mop a floor. I could probably mop a floor.

Merry Xmas, everyone. And Happy New Year. Smoke this weed. It will get you distractingly high.

## Strength Notes

This really got me in the knees. It's the kind of bud you have to warn your “every now and then” friends about.

## Taste Notes

Not superlative for taste, but a very smooth hit and maybe some notes of pine.

## Quality Notes

Very attractive. Big fluffy buds still nice and fresh. But well cured and ground up like a treat. I'd definitely get this shit again.

## Overall Notes

An exciting beginning to the year. Terrific weed with super high potency and not much to complain about. I had a great time, thanks. I'm going to reward myself with a sandwich and a ginger beer.
