Smoking this weed is like getting punched in the face by a pillow. It's got a nice gentle strength. Like Neil DeGrasse Tyson. I have not tried flower from Binske before,. I don't think. It makes me think of the Penske File.

So – nice bud. Not like yowza yowza strong but super nice to smoke. Also the packaging is worth mentioning – not only is this a nicer jar than you generally get – they've also got that lovely flamingo cutout. And I do like it when people care about the presentation layer a little bit. Especially if I like their sense of aesthetics, which I do in this case.

Slurrple is worth a try. Also my first time with this strain. I was hoping for grape taste, but instead it's a bit piny and cheesy.

## Strength Notes

I'm trying to adhere to the principle that I write all of this while I am under the effect. I wonder if that was a good idea? I think so?

This weed is pretty distracting. It comes on slow but then eventually I feel like pleasantly disabled. My brain she don't work so good right now. And that's… okay.

I'm giving this a slightly lower score because I think I was pretty tired when I smoked and that's part of it. Who knows, right? Who even knows what day it is?

I've been binge watching a few seasons of Alone this week and I really think they should stop being so afraid of bears on that show. No one seems to ever actually be in danger from them.

## Taste Notes

Tastes like pine and cheese and optimism. No grape.

## Quality Notes

Decent buds. Nice box.

## Overall Notes

If I was stranded alone with only ten items, one of them would not be this weed. In every other scenario, I would gladly enjoy this again. I notice that there is none of this left at the dispensary when I went back to check what I paid for it. So either it's very popular or some other weird thing.
