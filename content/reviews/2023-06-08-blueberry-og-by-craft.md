Now I'm not totally disappointed with this grass, but in the context of the other strains I have purchased at C.R.A.F.T.,this is not the best one. The bud is a bit crumbly and it's not a particularly nuanced high. It smoked a bit harsh, and it's just not, like, as amazing as other offerings from these guys. I'm not sure if it cured wrong or what, but I am going to bet something was just a little off in this batch.

Remember how Strawberry Shortcake had a best friend named Blueberry Muffin? How it that that never caught on amongst the general public? Because I think Raspberry Scone would be an awesome name for a human of any kind. Also, Cherry Tartlet. Though that might be a bit porn-y.

## Strength Notes

Decent strength, but without any real character. It's not like cheap vodka but that's the best analogy I can come up with from the alcohol sphere. Like it works great but you may not have the best time getting there with this particular vehicle. Maybe it's more like renting a Kia to go to Disney World?  I'll work on it.

## Taste Notes

The sheer neutrality of this bud is expressed most abundantly in its taste; there is none. It's like smoking nothing. Like a pleasant nothing- there's nothing wrong – it's just nothing. Not a hole, you understand.

A hole would have been something. This was… nothing.

Falcor!

## Quality Notes

The buds were admittedly beautiful before they crumbled to dust. And it's top shelf shit – it's got those pretty white and orange hairs and such. It's just like the most sort of ho hum version of all of those things.

## Overall Notes

I was not wildly impressed by this bud, but I smoked it all and in other markets this would get a rave review. In some sense these guys have spoiled me with some of the most affordable top quality bud I have smoked in the Bay Area, and so this, despite being very adequate, just failed in comparison to its siblings. So maybe it's the Stephen Baldwin of weed?
